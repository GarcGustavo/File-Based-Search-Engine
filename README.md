# File-Based-Search-Engine

Small search engine for specific words in documents. Not meant for large
amounts of files. Run it with cmd from the project folder with:

javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/systemClasses/Main.java

java -classpath bin systemClasses.Main

In linux, use equivalent commands based on your OS
